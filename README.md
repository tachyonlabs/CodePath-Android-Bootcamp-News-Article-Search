# Project 2 - News Article Search

News Article Search is an android app that allows a user to search for images on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [New York Times Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2).

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **search for news article** by specifying a query and launching a search. Search displays a grid of image results from the New York Times Search API.
* [x] User can click on "settings" which allows selection of **advanced search options** to filter results
* [x] User can configure advanced search filters such as:
  * [x] Begin Date (using a date picker)
  * [x] News desk values (Arts, Fashion & Style, Sports)
  * [x] Sort order (oldest or newest)
* [x] Subsequent searches have any filters applied to the search results
* [x] User can tap on any image in results to see the full text of article **full-screen**
* [ ] User can **scroll down to see more articles**. The maximum number of articles is limited by the API search.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Used the **ActionBar SearchView** or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText
* [x] Improved the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [x] Use the [RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) with the `StaggeredGridLayoutManager` to display improve the grid of image results

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Placeholder NYT "T" logo image in grid for articles that have no thumbnails
* [x] Opening "The New York Times Article Search" graphic so you don't just have a blank screen prior to searching
* [x] User's **search filters are saved to SharedPreferences**
* [x] Alert dialog requiring users choosing Select news desk values (as opposed to All values) to also select the departments they want to search
